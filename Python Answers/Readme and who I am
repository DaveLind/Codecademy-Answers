#Read Me and who I am!

My name is David Lindeque. I am a 23 year old academic/entrepreneur from South Africa. I have a finance and economics background
but love anything tech related. I founded Zest Mobile, South Africa's leading smartphone brand and have been involved with various 
companies, in different capacities, which include Afrihost, Qualcomm, Mediatek, Microsoft and Emie Design.
